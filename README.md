Learning Tool Overview: 

This learning tool drew inspiration from Uruguayan economist Eduardo Galeano’s book Open Veins of Latin America. This book was published in 1971 and explained how the Latin American continent has been impacted by mining. The tool built in this body of work is designed to extend transparency of mineral acquisition practices to the rest of the world.

Data: Production data for this work is acquired from mineral commodity reports published by oldest national geological surveys, the United States Geological Survey and the British Geological Survey. Mineral commodity reports discuss over forty items. For this work, the analyses of production data is constrained to ten mineral commodities: bauxite, cobalt, copper, gold, iron, lithium, manganese, nickel, phosphorus, and silver. Production data spanning at least 80 years for every material is recorded by Amazon TextTract and manual transcription. Some historical production is reported for territorial entities that no longer exist. To incorporate these data, totals are divided among their modern successor states. Without information on how production was distributed within the original territory, this approach may artificially increase the apparent production of individual successor states.
